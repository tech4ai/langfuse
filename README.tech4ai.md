To handle this situation effectively, you can use a strategy that involves forking and using Git's upstream tracking capabilities. Here's a step-by-step process:

1. **Fork the Original Repository:**
   - Go to the original repository on GitHub and click on the "Fork" button. This creates a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.

2. **Clone Your Fork Locally:**
   - Use the following command to clone the forked repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
     ```
   - Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `REPO_NAME` with your actual GitHub username and the name of the repository.

3. **Add the Original Repository as an Upstream Remote:**
   - Navigate into your cloned repository:
     ```bash
     cd REPO_NAME
     ```
   - Add the original repository as an upstream remote:
     ```bash
     git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/REPO_NAME.git
     ```

4. **Make and Commit Your Changes:**
   - Make any modifications you need within your local copy and commit them to your fork using:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Your commit message"
     ```

5. **Push Changes to Your Fork:**
   - Push your changes to your fork on GitHub:
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```
   - Replace `main` with the appropriate branch name if necessary.

6. **Staying Updated with the Original Repo:**
   - Periodically, you will need to fetch the latest changes from the original repository and merge them into your fork. First, fetch the upstream changes:
     ```bash
     git fetch upstream
     ```
   - Merge them into your main branch (or another appropriate branch):
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git merge upstream/main
     ```
   - Resolve any merge conflicts if they arise, commit the merge, and then push these updates to your fork:
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```

By following these steps, you'll be able to maintain your own changes while also keeping your fork updated with any changes made in the original repository.
